# Datavue

Datavue is a chart / data visualization library build in native Vue and maximizing performance of
dynamic updates by directly exploiting vue reactivity.

This is a very early stage project.

Currently, there is support for bar charts, stacked bar charts and pie charts.
Multiple series can be used in a single chart (stacked) bar chart.
More types of charts will be added later.

Refer to Demo.vue for an example of how to use the different charts.
